#1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;
#1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS "Actor Name" FROM actor;

#2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name FROM actor
WHERE first_name="Joe";

#2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
SELECT last_name FROM actor
where last_name like "%GEN%";

#2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT last_name, first_name FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE "%Li%"
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name;

#2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
SELECT country_id, country FROM country
WHERE country IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh','China');

#3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so create a column in the table actor named description and use the data type BLOB (Make sure to research the type BLOB, as the difference between it and VARCHAR are significant).
ALTER TABLE actor ADD description BLOB AFTER last_update;

#3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the description column.
ALTER TABLE actor DROP description;

#4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) as c FROM actor GROUP BY last_name;

#4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*)
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

#4c. The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS. Write a query to fix the record.
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
UPDATE actor 
   SET first_name = REPLACE(first_name, 'GROUCHO', 'HARPO') WHERE last_name='Williams';

#4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO.
UPDATE actor
SET first_name= REPLACE(first_name, 'HARPO','GROUCHO');


#5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
SHOW CREATE TABLE address;

#6a. Use JOIN to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:

FROM staff
INNER JOIN address ON staff.address_id=address.address_id;

#6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.

WHERE MONTH(payment.payment_date)=8 and YEAR(payment.payment_date)=2005
GROUP BY staff.staff_id;

#6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.

FROM payment
INNER JOIN customer ON payment.customer_id=customer.customer_id
GROUP BY customer.customer_id
ORDER BY last_name ASC;

#7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters K and Q have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters K and Q whose language is English.

Select title 
FROM film
WHERE language_id IN
(SELECT language_id
FROM language
WHERE name= 'English') AND
title Like 'K%' or title Like 'Q%';

#7b. Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film Alone Trip.

INNER JOIN inventory ON rental.inventory_id=inventory.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film_category ON inventory.film_id= film_category.film_id
INNER JOIN category ON film_category.category_id=category.category_id
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY SUM(payment.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;

#8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.
CREATE VIEW genre_rev AS
SELECT SUM(payment.amount), payment.rental_id, inventory.inventory_id, inventory.film_id, category.category_id, category.name
FROM payment
INNER JOIN rental ON payment.rental_id=rental.rental_id
